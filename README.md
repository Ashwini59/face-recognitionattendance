# face-recognitionattendance

This project is a web-based application that utilizes face recognition(openCV) technology to identify and verify individuals. The website provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload images or capture images using webcam for face recognition.

## Features

1. **Face Detection:** The website uses computer vision algorithms to detect and locate faces in uploaded images or real-time camera input.

2. **Face Recognition:** Once a face is detected, the application compares the detected face with the faces stored in its database to recognize and identify individuals.

3. **User Verification:** The website provides a verification process to confirm the identity of registered users by comparing their uploaded images with the images captured through the camera.


## Technologies Used

The Face Recognition Website is developed using the following technologies:

- **Face Recognition API:** Libraries such as OpenCV, dlib , numpy , face_recognition are used to implement the face detection and recognition functionality.

## Usage

1. Upload an image or capture an image using the camera.

2. The website will detect and recognize faces in the uploaded/captured image and provide the results.

3. Mark your attendance in sheet.

## Conclusion

The Face Recognition Website provides a convenient and secure way to perform face detection and recognition tasks. It can be used in various applications, such as access control systems, user verification, attendance tracking, or personalized user experiences. With the right deployment and customization, this website can be tailored to meet specific business requirements.
